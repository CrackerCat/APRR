### Results

The results are generated by the `parse` utility working on a memory dump of a successful run of the `aprr.bin`. The tests are done with a single page of memory mapped with all 16 different possible TTE permissions. These 16 mappings are then each inserted in page tables with all 16 different possible HPD permissions. Then all of those mappings are tested for read, write and execute permission from EL1 and EL0 respectively. This entire test cycle is run four times, with PAN and WXN on and off each. The file names are:

`[APRR0_MASK]-[APRR1_MASK]-(NO)PAN-(NO)WXN.txt`

The first result block has 7 columns like this:

    EL1R EL1W EL0R EL0W KRN/USR (HPD/HPD) APRR

The first four columns are obtained via the `at` instruction, which translated virtual to physical addresses for reads and writes from EL1 and EL0 respectively. If the translation succeeded, an `okok` is emitted, otherwise `----`. Following that are the permissions specified in the TTE, then the HPD permissions specified for the page table, and finally the permissions granted by the APRR registers.

The second result block has four columns like this:

    [ACTUAL]  TTE     (HPD)     APRR

The last 3 columns are the same as above, and the first is simply the actual permissions observed when attempting to read from, write to, or execute the page in question fron EL1/EL0.
